Poolparty rails app example.


This repo contains an example of how to use poolparty to deploy a rails app to Amazon EC2.


Some things you need to do first:

- Setup an EC2 account.
- Setup EC2 credentials.
- Install poolparty






The examples was created using:
> rails poolparty_example

After that, the config/poolparty/ folder was added.



Things I needed to do:

- Modify environment.rb, so that RAILS_GEM_VERSION matched the has_gem_package declartion in cloud.rb
