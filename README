Poolparty rails app example.

This repo contains an example of how to use poolparty to deploy a rails app to Amazon EC2.


Stack: Apache2 + Passenger + Rails + SQLLite


Some things you need to do first:

- Setup an EC2 account.
- Setup EC2 credentials.
- Install poolparty



Starting your cloud:

If you installed poolparty via the gem:
> cloud-start -s config/poolparty/clouds.rb

If you installed the edge poolparty via git you need to point to the poolparty bin folder:
> ~/poolparty/bin/cloud-start -s config/poolparty/clouds.rb





The examples was created using:
> rails poolparty_example

After that, the config/poolparty/ folder was added.



Things I needed to do:

- Modify environment.rb, so that RAILS_GEM_VERSION matched the has_gem_package declartion in cloud.rb


- fix outdated rake on instance. the problem is that the 0.8.4 gem installed, but the older 0.8.1 is isntalled as a package.
first remove the package:
> apt-get remove rake
then symlink:
> ln -s /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.4/bin/rake /usr/bin/rake
