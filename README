Poolparty example.

This repo contains an example of how to use poolparty to deploy a rails app to Amazon EC2.
The stack used is: Apache2 + Passenger + Rails + SQLite

Some things you need to do first:

- Setup an EC2 account.
- Setup AWS certificates and credentials.
- Install poolparty



Starting your cloud:

If you installed poolparty via the gem:
> cloud-start

If you installed the edge poolparty via git you need to point to the poolparty bin folder (wherever you keep it):
> ~/poolparty/bin/cloud-start



The poolparty configuration files are stored in config/poolparty/






Things I needed to do to get this example working:
- Modify environment.rb, so that RAILS_GEM_VERSION matched the has_gem_package declartion in cloud.rb


Known problems:
- rake db:migrate fails on the instance with an error: rake aborted! undefined method `reenable' for <Rake::Task db:schema:dump => [environment]>:Rake::Task
