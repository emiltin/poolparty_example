Some things you need to do first:

- Setup an EC2 account.
- Setup AWS certificates and credentials.
- Install poolparty



Starting your cloud:

If you installed poolparty via the gem:
> cloud-start

If you installed the edge poolparty via git you need to point to the poolparty bin folder (wherever you keep it):
> ~/poolparty/bin/cloud-start



The poolparty configuration files are stored in config/poolparty/
